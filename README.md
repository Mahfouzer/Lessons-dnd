  note: sometimes the Back-end integrated version takes some time as the `glitch` service (instance) sleeps 
  so it may take 5~6 seconds to start and get back with data to the front-end through the API

 -it's really straight-forward code for json-server it's basicly forked of another JSON-server and deployed on glitch
